<H1> Alzheimer-Dementia-Detection </H1> 
<p> A Machine Learning model that predicts Alzheimer's disease using Brain MRI image classification and categorizes it into 4 classes namely: Mild demented, Moderate Demented, Non-Demented, and Very Mild Demented using Deep Learning.</p> </br>
<p>Compared performance of different pre-trained models on the balanced and unbalanced dataset of Brain MRI images. The technique used for balancing the dataset is SMOTE+ENN.</p>

<ul>
  <li>InceptionV3</li>
  <li>ResNet50</li>
  <li>VGG19</li>
</ul>
